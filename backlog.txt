 - Social Integration? Easy way to like and share. Forget Add This.

===========================================================================
RELEASE 3.2

STORIES

1. Enhancement: Qualify victories on the score screen
	Overwhelming/Dominant 
		- high army kill score component or(and?) greater than 2/3 win to loss ratio
		 - What is high?

	Close/Narrow (near 0 kill score component, near 0 score components for wins)
	Quick (few turns)
	Long (many turns)


2. UI Enhancement: Footer redesign.
	1. Add icons to tab labels user-icon for Army, glyphicon-flag for Fort
	2. Tab label text will remain but will be hidden in responsive views and the tabs resized
	3. Move Rank and stars into the Military tab.
		Rank bar fills up based on cumulative XP. 100% is 599 XP. Compute on the template.


BUGFIX:
	1. Army Kills and Casualties totals were not displaying in the sidebar when they should (source: logic only displayed the list items when overall kills were > 0, needed to include current turn kills also)

	2. Selected Footer - Army population disappeared when morale was between 20 and 25.

BACKLOG BY EFFORT


STORIES



SMALL EFFORT

1. Safari Bugs:
	Med Can't click the growth rate icons in the footer
	High Can't tab to End Turn button? (Safari ONLY?)

	- Launches modal
	- Modal has controls for random map, music, tips
	- WILL CONTROL (future):

MEDIUM


LARGE

	- Steal security PHP from Phil's contact form



==========================================
RELEASE BACKLOG (Unfiltered/Unsorted)


=======================================================================
BUGS

Try to find it:
 	1. Validation Error: Paragraph markup in modals.
 	2. Clicking to reinforce a territory somehow transfers the same exact XP level?



=======================================================================
Tech Debt

1. Territory model should be subdivided into classes like we did for nationStats model
	-- military
		-- army
		-- fort
	-- econ
	-- start
	-- prv
	-- ui

2. Refactor arrays stored on models into classes like was done for nationStats model (eg, policies)

=======================================================================
AI EPIC

1. On a time delay, AI will select territories and carry out attacks and reinforcements.

	- Dependencies:
		- Learning AI
		- Finishing Side Menu (In progress)
		- Policy enhancement (DONE)
		- Programmatically selecting a view (SOLVED) App.Views.allViews.terrClick();
			- Also created leftViews and rightViews to make the work easier
			- Make it better
				- Store CIDs into an array
		- Establishing difficulty settings (DONE)

GENERAL NOTES
	- AI will act in territories with warnings first

DIFFICULTY SETTINGS
	- Can be set from the game start view

	1. Easy
		- Enacts up to 2 policies at a time
		- Less aggression

	2. Normal
		- Enacts up to 3 policies at a time
		- Can change tax rate
		- Medium aggression
		- Addresses territories with warnings first

	3. Hard
		- Enacts up to 4 policies at a time
		- Can change tax rate
		- High aggression
		- Makes smartest strategic decisions
	
- Notes:
	Under no circumstances should one side be able to do anything based on what it "knows" about the other BEYOND what can be seen on the territories or in the attack modals

	AI will (depending on circumstance) operate on territories with alerts FIRST


=======================================================================

// Attack & Battle Window Epic
	Dependency: Unit Types

	1. UX/UI: Update attack logic so that you select the Army unit to attack with and what you are attacking
		Use button group inside the tab? Army / Navy / Air Force, etc

	2. UX/UI: Design Attack/Reinforce Modal
		- Tab concept
				Left column: Attacker
					Military unit types in checkbox groups for selection
						Shows Rank, XP, units, and morale for each type
					Selected unit types populate a panel showing attacking forces

				Right column: Defender
					Tabs for Miltary / Economic might 

				ATTACK button sets off the attack

		- Attack Modal
			- Includes name of attacker and defender
			- Attacker:
				- Buttons to select units
				- Army population
				- Army strength bar
					- Expand to see XP, Rank, Morale
				- Include special attack (Guerilla assault)
			- Defender:
				- Army population and strength
				- Strength bar breaks down to XP, Rank, Morale
				- Fort strength and level
				- Also includes civilian population, GDP, and economy strength

		- Reinforce Modal
			- Includes name of sending and receiving territory
			- Sender:
				- Input to show units being transferred (max amount pre-filled, and selected)
				- Shows unit's metrics - Population, strength (w/breakdown)
			
			- Receiver:
				- Fort level and strength
				- Army units and strength (w/breakdown)

	3. UX/UI: Window will house results from attacks
		Includes:
			Impact on attacking and defending territories
			Economic and Military impacts can be shown in tabs
			Idea: Progress bars for most metrics based on values RIGHT BEFORE battle (before battle = 100%)
			Other idea: Bar charts comparing casualties
			Other idea: Bar charts show starting (background) and ending values for morale, XP

	- Small impacts on morale

8. Tech Debt: Refactor territory model property for army "morale"
