===========================================================================
RELEASE 3.1



DONE




STORIES

1. UX: Economics - Random market crashes/booms.
	- These crashes should be less frequent than with low taxes
	- Low taxes crashes should never happen at the same time as these crashes (can't have two crashes in the same year by game logic)
	- Booms should mimic low tax impact but be short lived (no more than 5 years in a row)

//  AI DEPENDENCY, END GAME EXPERIENCE DEPENDENCY
2. UX/UI Side Menu: Overall Battle Record & Overall Stats
	- To mirror the statistics kept by current turn battle record

		Battle record - Store total battle wins/losses on Emp after each battle
		Invasions
			- Store on Emp models after each invasion (duplicates become 2, 3rd, 4th invasions, no difference for invasions of territories once owned)
		Lost territories
			- Store on emp models after each invasion (no duplicates, removed if re-invaded)
		
		Army + Civilian casualties - store after each battle, including invasion casualties
		Recruited units - store after every recruit (just need to store volunteers)
		Armies ranked above 1 - updated after every battle
		Forts with levels above 1
		Forts destroyed - store each time a fort is destroyed (remove duplicates)
		Territories with movement warnings -- Create function on terrModel: canMove
		Territories with morale warnings -- Ditto: hasWarnings

	- Once tracked, add summary of kills and casualties to the end game window

BACKLOG BY EFFORT


STORIES



SMALL EFFORT

1. Safari Bugs:
	Med Can't click the growth rate icons in the footer
	Small Can see tooltips for the other side - Don't render the tooltips when it's not the active side

 	High Scroll first army into view on game start and after battles
 		-- May be related to scrolling selected terr into view?

// On hold until AI is developed
2. UI: Create Game Settings menu for home screen
	- Cog wheel icon with text "More Settings"
	- Launches modal
	- Modal has controls for random map, music, tips

MEDIUM

1. Tech Debt: Refactor territory model property for army "morale"
	Should be named "armyMorale"


LARGE

1. UX: Add an easy way to send feedback. Ideas, suggestions, bug reports.
	- PHP form? Is there a better way?
	- Steal security PHP from Phil's contact form

2. UX: End Game Experience *

=======================================================================
BUGS

Try to find it:
 	1. Validation Error: Paragraph markup in modals.
 	2. Clicking to reinforce a territory somehow transfers the same exact XP level?



=======================================================================
Tech Debt

1. Territory model should be subdivided into classes like we did for nationStats model
	-- military
		-- army
		-- fort
	-- econ
	-- start
	-- prv
	-- ui

2. Refactor arrays stored on models into classes like was done for nationStats model (eg, policies)

=======================================================================
AI EPIC

1. On a time delay, AI will select territories and carry out attacks and reinforcements.

	- Dependencies:
		- Learning AI
		- Finishing Side Menu (In progress)
		- Policy enhancement (DONE)
		- Programmatically selecting a view (SOLVED) App.Views.allViews.terrClick();
			- Make it better
				- Store CIDs into an array
		- Establishing difficulty settings (DONE)

GENERAL NOTES
	- AI will act in territories with warnings first

DIFFICULTY SETTINGS
	- Can be set from the game start view

	1. Easy
		- Enacts up to 2 policies at a time
		- Less aggression

	2. Normal
		- Enacts up to 3 policies at a time
		- Can change tax rate 
		- Medium aggression
		- Can "manually" change territory values

	3. Hard
		- Enacts up to 4 policies at a time
		- Can change tax rate
		- High aggression
		- Can "manually" recruit, upgrade, repair
		- Makes smartest strategic decisions
	
- Notes:
	Under no circumstances should one side be able to do anything based on what it "knows" about the other BEYOND what can be seen on the territories or in the attack modals

	AI will (depending on circumstance) operate on territories with alerts FIRST

	1. UX/UI: Update attack logic so that you select the Army unit to attack with and what you are attacking
		Use button group inside the tab? Army / Navy / Air Force, etc

	2. UX/UI: Design Attack/Reinforce Modal
		- Tab concept
				Left column: Attacker
					Military unit types in checkbox groups for selection
						Shows Rank, XP, units, and morale for each type
					Selected unit types populate a panel showing attacking forces

				Right column: Defender
					Tabs for Miltary / Economic might 

				ATTACK button sets off the attack

				- Include special attack (Guerilla assault)

	3. UX/UI: Window will house results from attacks

			Other idea: Bar charts comparing casualties
			Other idea: Bar charts show starting (background) and ending values for morale, XP
