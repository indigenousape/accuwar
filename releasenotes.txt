Release Notes
3.2 Alpha
Release Date 8/26/2018


FEATURES

1. UI: Create a How to Play modal to communicate the basic idea in text form.
	- Added as an option to the Game Start Menu

2. UI: Create Game Settings menu for home screen
	- UI - Bootstrap Button dropdown: (1) Settings (2) Contact (3) How to Play
	- Settings display inline within the menu
	- Contact link opens a new browser tab
	- How to Play launches a descriptive modal


ENHANCEMENTS

1. UI: Policies Modal: Checked Available Policy checkboxes now appear at the top of the list.

2. UI: Final Score Modal:

	- Created a 150,000 point bonus

3. UI: Sidebar
	- Show count beside headings for territories invaded/lost, armies promoted, forts lost/destroyed
	- Show number of territories occupied out of total at top of territories list

4. Performance: Policies
	Performance between turns was very sluggish when all policies were enabled (especially in long game)
	- Sped up by refactoring the policy script
	- BEFORE: Opened each territory in an empire once for each enabled policy. Result was a maximum of 250 cycles opening and updating territories when all policies were enabled in a long game.
	- AFTER: Determine which policies each side can afford to carry out in EVERY territory (according to priority), and do those update in each of its territories in one pass. Then for the remaining policy that can be partially afforded, open the territories one at the time again and apply the update until the treasury runs out. Result is a maximum of 100 cycles when all policies are enabled in a long game.

	- See: terrCollection.js - App.Collections.terrCollection.multiplePoliciesInFull();

BUGFIXES

- Repair All Forts and Repair All Infrastructure menu buttons missing from right side menu at turn start
- Army Training - Notification message indicated +25 XP but added a different amount to the army

	- Enact policies
	- Enacting a policy requires assigning its priority (radio buttons)

			- Modal shows active policies sorted by priority
			- Then inactive policies
			- Intro paragraph introducing the general concept of policies
			- No changes are saved until the user clicks the confirm button
			- Example:
				Repair infrastructure [x] P1 [] P2 [] P3 [] P4 [] Inactive
				Repair forts [] P1 [x] P2 [] P3 [] P4 [] Inactive
				Upgrade technology  [] P1 [] P2 [] P3 [] P4 [x] Inactive
				Recruit army units [] P1 [] P2 [] P3 [] P4 [x] Inactive

			- Recruit army units is special

	- Policy: Repair forts!

	- Policy: Technology boost!

			Upgrade costs are deducted from the treasury.

	- Policies should be enacted in 'smart' order
		- Repair forts/infrastructure from most to least damaged
		- Recruit units in territories with smaller armies first
		- Upgrade tech levels in the places with the lowest level (replaces average approach - remove from sidebar?)

2. UX/UI: Average Tech level impacts army battle strength
		Each empire's average tech level adds a strength bonus on the battlefield 
		Each level is worth an additional 25% strength bonus
		Impact appears on attack modal

2. Tech Debt/Bugfix: Color Selector
	- BUG: When user is focused on a select menu and types 'o' as Player 1, they can access the hidden option. (old method of hiding the options)
	- Created view for the select menu and options
	- Used the GameStart model to store the available and selected colors for each side
	- Created ColorView to rerender the menus on the fly without rerendering the entire template

3. Color selector was broken.
	In Long game mode, after changing P2 colors from default, the territory tabs display as the wrong color (or as no color at all) in attack mode. 

4. Couldn't select a random map in Long Game mode.

=========================================================================
Release Notes
-1.1 Pre-Alpha
Release Date: 8/13/2017

New Features

1. Turns - Empire and Territory
	
	Each territory within the empire can do certain things during each empire's turn
	
	Some actions will end a Territory Turn:
		Attacking
		Sending reinforcements
		Training army units
		Recruiting army units
	
	Other actions do not impact Territory Turns:
		Repairing infrastructure
		Repairing fort strength
		Upgrade tech levels

	Empire Turns can end three ways
	
	1. User can click the "Next Turn" button to end the empire's turn and give control to the other user
		User must confirm their choice
	
	2. Empire turns advance automatically after all territories turns have ended
		Users are alerted to inform them of the empire turn ending
	
	3. User can click the Restart button to end the turn and restart the game
		User must confirm their choice

	NOTES
	Can only change your empire's name and tax rate during your empire's turn 

2. Loading Experience
		Added a start screen and loading experience
		Start screen defines side names
		Form fields are validated as the user types and provide feedback
		When fields are valid, Declare War button displays 

3. Taxes and Civilian Morale
	When taxes are raised, morale goes down by the amount of the increase (1% raised = -1 morale)
	When taxes are lowered, morale goes up by the amount of the decrease (1% lowered = +1 morale)
	Low taxes (below 35%) adds up to 5 points to civilian morale each turn
	High taxes (above 50%) subtracts up to 5 points from civlian morale each turn
	High taxes for 3 more than consecutive turns triggers an additional drag on morale and GDP
		The size of the drag goes up over time

4. Army Training
	Purchase 25% of remaining XP
	Very expensive generally
	Cost based on size of army and raw amount of experience points to be earned
	Larger armies gaining more XP will cost more than smaller armies gaining the same amount
	Cost increases with army rank
	Ends territory turn

Economics Logic
GDP + Treasury amounts start in the billions instead of millions for realism

Military Logic
Repairing damaged forts and upgrading fort levels now improve army unit morale

UX Enhancements

1. After invading a territory, the invaded territory is immediately selected and its details displayed

2. Number Formatting: All population and dollar amounts now include commas for visual clarity 

3. Battle Map: Selected Mode Cursor Enhancements
	Cursor "not-allowed" when hovering over territories that are out of range
	Border box no longer displays over territories that are out of range
	Cursor for reinforcements is now a plus sign

	Army rank displayed as stars
	Progress bar displays army unit size, XP, and Morale
	Green = No civilian morale penalty based on troop strength
	Yellow = Civilian morale penalty based on troop strength
	Red = Unable to attack

5. Added confirmaton prompts after clicking Next Turn or Restart to prevent user mistakes

Technical Debt
1. Performance improvement
	Moved Clicked & Selected Tile models to the global namespace so they wouldn't be attached to each territory	

2. Updated constants to resolve inconsistent use of deprecated ATTACK_MINIMUM constant

 - Fort Levels can be upgraded (Max Level: 10) from the treasury


Economic Concepts

GDP
 - Impacted by population, tech level, citizen morale, and infrastructure
 - Total is taxed for additional next turn treasury
 - Tax rate is controlled by clicking the projected treasury in the top menu bar

Civilian Population
 - Suffers casualties proportional to size of attacks
 - Protected from casualties by fort strength
 - Contributes to territory GDP
 - Grows based on territory's population growth rate

Civilian population growth rate
 - Based on infrastructure strength, tech level, and civilian morale

Infrastructure
 - Contributes to GDP, civilian morale, and population growth rate
 - Takes damage proportional to size of attack
 - Protected from damage by fort strength

Tech level
 - Contributes to GDP, civilian morale, and population growth rate
 - Reduced when infrastructure strength takes damage greater than its available strength

Civilian morale
 - Contributes to population growth rate and GDP
 - Impacted by:
	Fort strength (+/-)
	Fort level (+/-)
	Infrastructure strength (+/-)
	Army population (+/-)
	Tech level (+)
	Army/Civilian casualties (when attacked) (-)
	Empire battle outcomes (+/-)
